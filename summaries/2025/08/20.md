# Activity Summary for 8/20/2025

## 10:18:00 AM
The log shows development of two HTML files (`fish.html`, `hii.html`) and associated CSS and JavaScript files.

**`fish.html` (8/20/2025, 9:18 AM - 9:30 AM):** This file underwent several iterations.  Initially, it was a simple page with a single image and text.  Subsequently, a carousel component was added to display multiple images, along with a description, movie title ("Finding Nemo"), and a "watch now" button.  Finally,  the button styling was refined by wrapping it within a div with the class "button-style" for better layout control.  The styling of this button was further modified in later commits (9:30 AM - 9:31 AM)

**`fish.css` (8/20/2025, 9:20 AM - 9:31 AM):** This file contains styles for the `fish.html` page.  The `container` element's height was adjusted repeatedly (from `10vh` to `130vh` and then back down to `115vh`), indicating experimentation with layout.  There were also styles added to round the corners of various elements.  Finally,  additional styles for `.button-style`  were added to center the button horizontally.


**`hi.js` (8/20/2025, 9:43 AM - 10:16 AM):**  This JavaScript file started with empty `console.log` statements, eventually evolving into a function `function_name()` that modifies the text content and color of an h1 element identified by the ID "heading_element"  in `hii.html`.  There was a period of debugging and variable renaming  (evident by the changes from `get_heading` to `get_heading_id` and `get_heading_element`),  demonstrating iterative development and refinement of the Javascript code.

**`hii.html` (8/20/2025, 9:45 AM - 10:12 AM):** This file started as a basic HTML page and gradually incorporated Bootstrap styling and functionality.  A button was added, and its styling was modified using Bootstrap classes (from `btn btn-primary` to `btn btn-dark` and back).  The `onclick` event handler was added to the button, connecting it to the  `function_name()` defined in `hi.js`. The final version includes external links to Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript, as well as the custom `hi.js` and `hi.css` files.  The ID of the heading element was also corrected from `heading` to `heading_element` to match the JS.

In summary, the log shows a progressive development process, with multiple iterations of styling and layout adjustments in the CSS and HTML files and multiple attempts and refinements in the Javascript file to implement dynamic changes to the page content.  The use of Bootstrap framework is consistent throughout the changes made to `fish.html` and `hii.html`.
