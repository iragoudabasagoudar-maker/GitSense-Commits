# Activity Summary for 8/20/2025

## 10:18:00 AM
The log shows development of two HTML files (`fish.html`, `hii.html`) and associated CSS and JavaScript files.

**`fish.html` (8/20/2025, 9:18 AM - 9:30 AM):** This file underwent several iterations.  Initially, it was a simple page with a single image and text.  Subsequently, a carousel component was added to display multiple images, along with a description, movie title ("Finding Nemo"), and a "watch now" button.  Finally,  the button styling was refined by wrapping it within a div with the class "button-style" for better layout control.  The styling of this button was further modified in later commits (9:30 AM - 9:31 AM)

**`fish.css` (8/20/2025, 9:20 AM - 9:31 AM):** This file contains styles for the `fish.html` page.  The `container` element's height was adjusted repeatedly (from `10vh` to `130vh` and then back down to `115vh`), indicating experimentation with layout.  There were also styles added to round the corners of various elements.  Finally,  additional styles for `.button-style`  were added to center the button horizontally.


**`hi.js` (8/20/2025, 9:43 AM - 10:16 AM):**  This JavaScript file started with empty `console.log` statements, eventually evolving into a function `function_name()` that modifies the text content and color of an h1 element identified by the ID "heading_element"  in `hii.html`.  There was a period of debugging and variable renaming  (evident by the changes from `get_heading` to `get_heading_id` and `get_heading_element`),  demonstrating iterative development and refinement of the Javascript code.

**`hii.html` (8/20/2025, 9:45 AM - 10:12 AM):** This file started as a basic HTML page and gradually incorporated Bootstrap styling and functionality.  A button was added, and its styling was modified using Bootstrap classes (from `btn btn-primary` to `btn btn-dark` and back).  The `onclick` event handler was added to the button, connecting it to the  `function_name()` defined in `hi.js`. The final version includes external links to Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript, as well as the custom `hi.js` and `hi.css` files.  The ID of the heading element was also corrected from `heading` to `heading_element` to match the JS.

In summary, the log shows a progressive development process, with multiple iterations of styling and layout adjustments in the CSS and HTML files and multiple attempts and refinements in the Javascript file to implement dynamic changes to the page content.  The use of Bootstrap framework is consistent throughout the changes made to `fish.html` and `hii.html`.


## 11:18:00 AM
The log shows development of two HTML files, `hii.html` and `cat.html`, along with a CSS file, `cat.css`,  between 10:20 AM and 11:17 AM on August 20, 2025.

`hii.html` initially included Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript, and linked to a `hi.js` file.  The `onclick` event handler of a button was modified, initially being an empty function and subsequently changed to call the `gajama` function and then `function_name`.  There were several minor edits to the HTML structure, primarily involving the placement of the `<script>` tag including `hi.js` and the addition of a stray `<link>` tag which was removed later.  The most significant changes occurred early in the sequence (around 10:20 AM).


`hi.js` contained JavaScript code to change the text and color of an h1 element, with the function name altered from `gajama` to `function_name`.


`cat.html` underwent more extensive modifications. It started as a simple HTML file, and then Bootstrap was added.  The initial content was a simple `<div>`, which gradually evolved into a container with an image (`https://d2clawv67efefq.cloudfront.net/ccbp-dynamic-webapps/bulb-go-on-img.png`)  and styling applied via `cat.css`.  Several modifications to this image's container and the image's class, its size and the image itself were made. Finally, the image was replaced with an image of a cat and some text.  The most significant changes happened between 10:49 AM and 11:17 AM.

`cat.css` started with incomplete CSS rules, gradually refining the styling for a `div` with class "cat-style"  and later ".dark-background" and ".blub".  The final version sets background color to black and defines the size of the ".blub" class. The significant changes to the CSS occured between 10:51 AM and 11:17 AM.  There is a pattern of iterative refinement in the CSS, as well as adjustments to the image size in `cat.html`.


## 12:18:01 PM
The log shows the development of a simple HTML page displaying images of a cat and a light bulb, along with "Switch On/Off" buttons.  The `cat.html` file underwent numerous revisions, primarily focusing on the layout and styling of images and buttons.  Changes were made frequently between 11:18 AM and 12:05 PM, with a significant gap before further updates between 11:56 AM and 12:17 PM.

Initially, the `cat.html` file included placeholder text and an incorrectly linked image.  Over time, the text was removed, and correct images were added from a cloudfront URL (`https://d2clawv67efefq.cloudfront.net/...`). The images were styled using a `blub` class defined in `cat.css`. The images were initially displayed one below the other, later arranged with better layout using `div` elements and CSS classes like `text-center` and `flex-row-justify-content-center`.


The `cat.css` file was used to style the background color to black (`dark-background`), and the images to a height and width of 300px (`blub`).  Later, a `bord` class was added to style a gray box around the button.  The styling of this box was adjusted multiple times regarding height and width.

Finally, a JavaScript file (`cat1.js`) was introduced to add interactivity.  The initial version contained errors, but it was progressively refined to implement a function `switchOn()` that changes the source of the lightbulb image (`blubImage`) to a different image when the "ON" button is clicked.  The final `cat.html` shows an "ON" and "OFF" button, with the intention to switch the bulb image.  However, the functionality for the "OFF" button is not yet implemented in the provided log.  The final state of the lightbulb image shows the bulb is in the ON state with `id="bulbImage"`.  The cat image has the `id="catImage"`. The `On` button has the `id="button_id"`.
