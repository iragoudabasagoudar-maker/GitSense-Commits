# Activity Summary for 8/19/2025

## 10:59:25 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to an HTML file (`runner.html`) and a CSS file (`Taj.css`) over a period of roughly an hour on August 19, 2025.  The `runner.html` file undergoes iterative development, starting with a basic HTML structure including Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript libraries. These libraries are subsequently removed in a series of edits.

The initial edits to `runner.html` focused on the nested `<div>` structure, followed by the addition of a heading ("Favourite Places") and content about the Taj Mahal.  There is a period of incremental text editing within the paragraph describing the Taj Mahal (between 10:08:35 AM and 10:10:16 AM).

A significant change occurs around 10:11:08 AM where an image of the Taj Mahal is added to the HTML, then removed shortly after. Following this, a CSS file (`Taj.css`) is introduced and undergoes several edits  (10:13:55 AM onwards) to style the image, initially attempting to set a background image using different URLs, with some attempts being incomplete or using incorrect syntax.  Finally, a working background image URL is added and the style is refined.

Further modifications to `runner.html` involve the addition of CSS classes (`main-style`, `Mahal`, `Photo`) to style the layout.  There are repeated attempts to adjust the positioning and display of the image using Bootstrap's flexbox utility classes.  These adjustments, alongside the image URL, are somewhat unstable, undergoing several changes before settling around 10:52:22 AM. There's also an attempt to incorporate Bootstrap into `runner.html` later in the process. Redundant jquery scripts are included multiple times and eventually persist until the final version of `runner.html`. A separate `aa.html` file was created and modified once, seemingly a separate unrelated project that utilizes Bootstrap as well.  The final versions of both `runner.html` and `Taj.css` show a more polished layout, indicating the completion of the primary styling and content updates.
