# Activity Summary for 8/19/2025

## 10:59:25 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to an HTML file (`runner.html`) and a CSS file (`Taj.css`) over a period of roughly an hour on August 19, 2025.  The `runner.html` file undergoes iterative development, starting with a basic HTML structure including Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript libraries. These libraries are subsequently removed in a series of edits.

The initial edits to `runner.html` focused on the nested `<div>` structure, followed by the addition of a heading ("Favourite Places") and content about the Taj Mahal.  There is a period of incremental text editing within the paragraph describing the Taj Mahal (between 10:08:35 AM and 10:10:16 AM).

A significant change occurs around 10:11:08 AM where an image of the Taj Mahal is added to the HTML, then removed shortly after. Following this, a CSS file (`Taj.css`) is introduced and undergoes several edits  (10:13:55 AM onwards) to style the image, initially attempting to set a background image using different URLs, with some attempts being incomplete or using incorrect syntax.  Finally, a working background image URL is added and the style is refined.

Further modifications to `runner.html` involve the addition of CSS classes (`main-style`, `Mahal`, `Photo`) to style the layout.  There are repeated attempts to adjust the positioning and display of the image using Bootstrap's flexbox utility classes.  These adjustments, alongside the image URL, are somewhat unstable, undergoing several changes before settling around 10:52:22 AM. There's also an attempt to incorporate Bootstrap into `runner.html` later in the process. Redundant jquery scripts are included multiple times and eventually persist until the final version of `runner.html`. A separate `aa.html` file was created and modified once, seemingly a separate unrelated project that utilizes Bootstrap as well.  The final versions of both `runner.html` and `Taj.css` show a more polished layout, indicating the completion of the primary styling and content updates.


## 11:58:46 AM
The log shows a series of edits to two HTML files (`runner.html`, `tajj.html`) and a CSS file (`Taj.css`).  The `runner.html` file underwent extensive modifications primarily focused on its layout and image inclusion. Initially, it contained  a base HTML structure with Bootstrap and jQuery CDN links, and a placeholder image encoded in base64.  Subsequent changes involved restructuring the HTML to improve the layout using Bootstrap classes (`d-flex`, `flex-row`, etc.),  and numerous attempts to correctly source an image of the Taj Mahal.  The image source URL changed repeatedly, eventually settling on  "https://i0.wp.com/landlopers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Taj-Mahal-India.jpg?fit=1854%2C1512&ssl=1".  There was also a removal of the base64 encoded image and a significant period of experimentation with image paths and attributes before the final version.  The  `Taj.css` file was modified to style the page elements, primarily focusing on background color, image size and shape, and finally settling on a background image.   Finally a new file `tajj.html` was created, showing a different layout, including multiple images of Indian landmarks, using bootstrap styles and a custom stylesheet `tajj1.css`.  The  `kraimamu.html` file started as an empty file and then evolved to include a basic HTML structure with Bootstrap CDN links.  The most significant changes occurred between 11:00 AM and 11:30 AM for `runner.html` and around 11:45 AM for `tajj.html`.  The overall pattern in the `runner.html` file's modifications points towards iterative development and debugging of the HTML structure and image loading.
