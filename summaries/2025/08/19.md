# Activity Summary for 8/19/2025

## 10:59:25 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to an HTML file (`runner.html`) and a CSS file (`Taj.css`) over a period of roughly an hour on August 19, 2025.  The `runner.html` file undergoes iterative development, starting with a basic HTML structure including Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript libraries. These libraries are subsequently removed in a series of edits.

The initial edits to `runner.html` focused on the nested `<div>` structure, followed by the addition of a heading ("Favourite Places") and content about the Taj Mahal.  There is a period of incremental text editing within the paragraph describing the Taj Mahal (between 10:08:35 AM and 10:10:16 AM).

A significant change occurs around 10:11:08 AM where an image of the Taj Mahal is added to the HTML, then removed shortly after. Following this, a CSS file (`Taj.css`) is introduced and undergoes several edits  (10:13:55 AM onwards) to style the image, initially attempting to set a background image using different URLs, with some attempts being incomplete or using incorrect syntax.  Finally, a working background image URL is added and the style is refined.

Further modifications to `runner.html` involve the addition of CSS classes (`main-style`, `Mahal`, `Photo`) to style the layout.  There are repeated attempts to adjust the positioning and display of the image using Bootstrap's flexbox utility classes.  These adjustments, alongside the image URL, are somewhat unstable, undergoing several changes before settling around 10:52:22 AM. There's also an attempt to incorporate Bootstrap into `runner.html` later in the process. Redundant jquery scripts are included multiple times and eventually persist until the final version of `runner.html`. A separate `aa.html` file was created and modified once, seemingly a separate unrelated project that utilizes Bootstrap as well.  The final versions of both `runner.html` and `Taj.css` show a more polished layout, indicating the completion of the primary styling and content updates.


## 11:58:46 AM
The log shows a series of edits to two HTML files (`runner.html`, `tajj.html`) and a CSS file (`Taj.css`).  The `runner.html` file underwent extensive modifications primarily focused on its layout and image inclusion. Initially, it contained  a base HTML structure with Bootstrap and jQuery CDN links, and a placeholder image encoded in base64.  Subsequent changes involved restructuring the HTML to improve the layout using Bootstrap classes (`d-flex`, `flex-row`, etc.),  and numerous attempts to correctly source an image of the Taj Mahal.  The image source URL changed repeatedly, eventually settling on  "https://i0.wp.com/landlopers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Taj-Mahal-India.jpg?fit=1854%2C1512&ssl=1".  There was also a removal of the base64 encoded image and a significant period of experimentation with image paths and attributes before the final version.  The  `Taj.css` file was modified to style the page elements, primarily focusing on background color, image size and shape, and finally settling on a background image.   Finally a new file `tajj.html` was created, showing a different layout, including multiple images of Indian landmarks, using bootstrap styles and a custom stylesheet `tajj1.css`.  The  `kraimamu.html` file started as an empty file and then evolved to include a basic HTML structure with Bootstrap CDN links.  The most significant changes occurred between 11:00 AM and 11:30 AM for `runner.html` and around 11:45 AM for `tajj.html`.  The overall pattern in the `runner.html` file's modifications points towards iterative development and debugging of the HTML structure and image loading.


## 12:58:46 PM
The log shows edits to two HTML files (`kraimamu.html`, `nn.html`) and a CSS file (`taj.css`).

`kraimamu.html` underwent extensive modifications throughout the log.  Initially, it was a basic HTML file with a Bootstrap-based carousel, but without image sources.  Between 12:00 PM and 12:04 PM, image sources were added to the carousel, with several edits changing and adding different image URLs.  Around 12:18 PM, the carousel was removed entirely, leaving only a `<div>` element which was subsequently styled with a class "taj-taj" and linked to an external CSS file (`taj.css`). The final version of the HTML  includes a title, links to Bootstrap CSS and JS files, and an image carousel, all wrapped within a div with the class "m-5" for margin.  A heading "Taja Mahal" is also added. There is also a brief period where a duplicate carousel was added within a paragraph element in the final stages of the editing process. This shows the iterative nature of the development process.

`taj.css` was created to style the "taj-taj" div. Initially it was empty, then received a background image which was subsequently altered and finally a 50px margin was applied. The edits suggest an attempt to add a background image to a div in the html file.

`nn.html` started as a simple HTML file. It was then modified to embed a YouTube video, with the video ID changing once (from `zpOULjyy-n8` to `hSBwq8yrXf0`). Finally, Bootstrap  was added and the video link was reset to `https://www.youtube.com/embed/?rel=0` before the final commit.

The timestamps reveal a period of intensive work around midday (12:00 PM - 12:04 PM) and another session in the late afternoon involving the styling and final adjustments of `kraimamu.html`. The `nn.html` file was edited after the extensive edits were complete on `kraimamu.html`.  The changes to both HTML files show a pattern of including and removing elements as part of an iterative development cycle.  The final commits of `kraimamu.html` show only minor modifications.


## 1:58:35 PM
The log shows a single code change affecting `c:\Users\ssmsb\Desktop\aniket f\aniket3\nn.html` on August 19, 2025, at 12:59:26 PM.  This change consists of an HTML file embedding a YouTube video (`https://www.youtube.com/embed/v1FAaUxF0kg?rel=0`) using an iframe within a responsive div.  The HTML includes standard meta tags for character set and viewport settings.  There are no recurring elements or patterns beyond standard HTML structure.
