# Activity Summary for 8/16/2025

## 10:24:54 AM
The log shows a single file, `var.js`, undergoing numerous modifications between 9:26 AM and 10:19 AM on August 16, 2025.  Initially, `var.js` contained commented-out code demonstrating various JavaScript concepts: conditional statements, ternary operators, object manipulation, Math functions, array methods (slice and filter), spread syntax for arrays and objects, destructuring, error handling with try-catch blocks, and asynchronous operations with Promises.  Between 9:35 AM and 9:44 AM the commented-out code was repeatedly uncommented and commented out again.  This suggests an exploration or testing phase.

Later, from 9:51 AM onwards, the file was repeatedly modified to include an `async` function.  This function initially was incomplete, but progressively evolved to fetch data from the `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts` API, then to the `/users/1` endpoint to retrieve a user's name.  There were several attempts to correctly log the user's name.

Finally, all the previously written code in `var.js` was commented out and left empty before the final commit at 10:19 AM.


A separate file, `math.js`, was created and modified between 10:14 AM and 10:19 AM on the same day. This file contained functions for basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).  Initially, the file only contained `export` then it was modified to contain the add function. Further edits added the remaining operations, and finally some test calls to the functions were added.


The file `app.js` was created and modified between 10:16 AM and 10:17 AM.  It imports functions from `math.js` and then uses the imported functions in various test calls which are shown in the output.  The testing of `math.js` functions seems to have been done in `app.js` file and `math.js` file and finally left commented out in `math.js` file.
