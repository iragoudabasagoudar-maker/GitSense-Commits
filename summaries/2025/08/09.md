# Activity Summary for 8/9/2025

## 10:30:24 AM
The log shows a single code change to `c:\Users\ssmsb\myreactapp\src\App.js` on August 9th, 2025 at 9:51:32 AM.  This change involves creating a simple login/registration form within the `App` component. The form includes input fields for username, email, password, age, phone number, date of birth, and gender (with radio buttons).  There are also buttons for login, register, forgot password, and logout, along with a seemingly redundant "submit" button. The code uses basic HTML elements within the React component's JSX.  The `login` component is imported but not used within this specific commit.


## 11:30:24 AM
The log shows development of two files: `db.js` and `authMiddleware.js`.

`db.js` (config folder) was modified extensively between 10:50 AM and 11:00 AM.  The changes involved setting up a database connection using Mongoose.  Initially, the code was incomplete, gradually adding `require('mongoose')`, an asynchronous `connectdb` function, and finally, connecting to a MongoDB URI from environment variables (`process.env.MONGO_URI`). Error handling was implemented using a `try...catch` block to log errors and exit the process with code 1 if the connection fails.  The `connectdb` function was then exported as `connectDB` at the end.  The spelling of "connected" was corrected during this time.


`authMiddleware.js` (middleware folder) was developed between 11:05 AM and 11:14 AM.  This file creates an authentication middleware function using `jsonwebtoken`. The middleware checks if a token is provided in the `Authorization` header and verifies it using a secret key from environment variables (`process.env.JWT_SECRET`). If the token is invalid or missing, it returns a 401 status with an appropriate error message.  If successful, the user ID from the decoded token is attached to the request object (`req.user`), and execution continues to the next middleware. Error handling within the `try...catch` block ensures that invalid tokens result in a 401 error response with a detailed error message ("Token is not valid"). The middleware is then exported at the end.


## 12:30:24 PM
The log shows development of a Mongoose user schema and a backend server.

Between 11:55 AM and 11:59 AM, the `user.js` file (located in `c:\Users\ssmsb\myreactapp\models\`) was progressively built.  Initially empty, it evolved to include `mongoose` import, schema definition for `email` (string, required, unique) and `password` (string, required) fields, and finally, the export of the `User` model. There were several minor edits, primarily involving correcting syntax errors and adding missing braces and colons.

Around 12:15 PM, the `.env` file in the backend directory was edited to define the MongoDB connection string (`MONGO_URI`) and a JWT secret (`JWT_SECRET`), ultimately settling on `MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/logindatabase` and specifying a port for the server.


From 12:24 PM to 12:27 PM, the `server.js` file (located in `c:\Users\ssmsb\myreactapp\backend\`) was developed.  It imports necessary modules (`express`, `cors`, `dotenv`, `connectDB`, and `authRoutes`), configures environment variables using `dotenv`, connects to the database via `connectDB()`, sets up middleware for CORS and JSON parsing, and finally mounts the `authRoutes` at the `/api/auth` endpoint.  There were a few minor edits to the file as well.


## 1:30:24 PM
The log shows development of a backend API, specifically an authentication endpoint.  The `server.js` file was initially set up, with several quick edits focusing on correctly setting the port and starting the server. This occurred between 12:35 PM and 12:36 PM.  A later edit at 12:46 PM corrected the `dotenv.config()` call.

The `authRoutes.js` file underwent more extensive development between 12:47 PM and 1:25 PM.  Initially, it was a blank file.  The file was incrementally built to include necessary imports (`bcrypt`, `jsonwebtoken`, `User` model, `authMiddleware`), defining a router, and finally creating a `/login` POST endpoint.  This endpoint handles user login attempts, verifying credentials against a database using bcrypt for password comparison and generating JWT tokens upon successful authentication using jsonwebtoken. Error handling was added to manage invalid credentials and server errors.  The completed endpoint returns a JSON object containing the JWT token and user's email.
