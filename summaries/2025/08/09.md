# Activity Summary for 8/9/2025

## 10:30:24 AM
The log shows a single code change to `c:\Users\ssmsb\myreactapp\src\App.js` on August 9th, 2025 at 9:51:32 AM.  This change involves creating a simple login/registration form within the `App` component. The form includes input fields for username, email, password, age, phone number, date of birth, and gender (with radio buttons).  There are also buttons for login, register, forgot password, and logout, along with a seemingly redundant "submit" button. The code uses basic HTML elements within the React component's JSX.  The `login` component is imported but not used within this specific commit.
