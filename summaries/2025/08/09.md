# Activity Summary for 8/9/2025

## 10:30:24 AM
The log shows a single code change to `c:\Users\ssmsb\myreactapp\src\App.js` on August 9th, 2025 at 9:51:32 AM.  This change involves creating a simple login/registration form within the `App` component. The form includes input fields for username, email, password, age, phone number, date of birth, and gender (with radio buttons).  There are also buttons for login, register, forgot password, and logout, along with a seemingly redundant "submit" button. The code uses basic HTML elements within the React component's JSX.  The `login` component is imported but not used within this specific commit.


## 11:30:24 AM
The log shows development of two files: `db.js` and `authMiddleware.js`.

`db.js` (config folder) was modified extensively between 10:50 AM and 11:00 AM.  The changes involved setting up a database connection using Mongoose.  Initially, the code was incomplete, gradually adding `require('mongoose')`, an asynchronous `connectdb` function, and finally, connecting to a MongoDB URI from environment variables (`process.env.MONGO_URI`). Error handling was implemented using a `try...catch` block to log errors and exit the process with code 1 if the connection fails.  The `connectdb` function was then exported as `connectDB` at the end.  The spelling of "connected" was corrected during this time.


`authMiddleware.js` (middleware folder) was developed between 11:05 AM and 11:14 AM.  This file creates an authentication middleware function using `jsonwebtoken`. The middleware checks if a token is provided in the `Authorization` header and verifies it using a secret key from environment variables (`process.env.JWT_SECRET`). If the token is invalid or missing, it returns a 401 status with an appropriate error message.  If successful, the user ID from the decoded token is attached to the request object (`req.user`), and execution continues to the next middleware. Error handling within the `try...catch` block ensures that invalid tokens result in a 401 error response with a detailed error message ("Token is not valid"). The middleware is then exported at the end.
