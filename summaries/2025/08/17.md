# Activity Summary for 8/17/2025

## 10:59:22 AM
The log shows modifications to two files: `script.js` and `index.html`.

`script.js` underwent extensive experimentation with variable declarations and assignments between 10:02 AM and 10:10 AM.  Initially, the code experimented with `var` declarations, then moved to using `const` and `let`, demonstrating learning about different variable scope and hoisting behaviors in JavaScript.  There were multiple attempts to declare and re-declare variables with the same name, and comments were added and removed to test code snippets. The variable names used were primarily `a` and then `b`.

`index.html` was developed from 10:11 AM to 10:20 AM.  The file was initially empty, then progressively built into a basic HTML structure including `<head>` and `<body>` elements. The `<head>` section received meta tags for character set and viewport, and the title was changed multiple times, settling on "BCA"  Finally, a simple structure was created in the body consisting of an `<h1>` element, a `<p>` element, and a `<button>` element.  There was a brief reversion back to an empty `<body>` at 10:19, then back to the "BCA" title, and a final incomplete `<h1>` tag at the end.


## 11:59:24 AM
The log shows development of a simple webpage.  Initially, an `index.html` file was created with basic HTML structure including a heading, paragraph, and button.  A `style.css` file was added and linked to the HTML around 11:08 AM.  The `script.js` file remained empty.

Significant changes to `style.css` involved styling the elements defined in `index.html`.  Between 11:14 AM and 11:15 AM, there was a period of correcting a typo in the `text-align` property for `.main-style`. Then,  the height and width of `.main-style` were adjusted several times between 11:15 AM and 11:22 AM, eventually settling on `height: 135px; width: 100%;`.  The button's border-radius was also added around 11:18 AM.  Subsequently, significant time was spent experimenting with font families for the `.button-style` class from around 11:19 AM to 11:26 AM, trying out "roboto", "monotono", "lobster" and finally settling on "Arial". A font size of 20px was also added.


Around 11:29 AM a new class `gajama-style` was added to the paragraph in `index.html`,  and its styling (background color and font size) was developed in `style.css` between 11:29 AM and 11:31 AM. Further styling adjustments to the heading (`heading-style`) and the paragraph (`gajama-style`) continued until 11:32 AM.

The final significant change started around 11:44 AM where the background color and text alignment were removed from `.main-style` in `style.css`, and a background image was added iteratively, with the size and URL adjusted and refined several times until settling on an image from `picfiles.alphacoders.com` around 11:51 AM. The background was further refined to use `background-size: cover; height: 100vh;` around 11:53 AM. The heading's background color was also removed around 11:52 AM.  The height and width of `.main-style` were commented out.
