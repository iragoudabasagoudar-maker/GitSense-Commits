# Activity Summary for 8/17/2025

## 10:59:22 AM
The log shows modifications to two files: `script.js` and `index.html`.

`script.js` underwent extensive experimentation with variable declarations and assignments between 10:02 AM and 10:10 AM.  Initially, the code experimented with `var` declarations, then moved to using `const` and `let`, demonstrating learning about different variable scope and hoisting behaviors in JavaScript.  There were multiple attempts to declare and re-declare variables with the same name, and comments were added and removed to test code snippets. The variable names used were primarily `a` and then `b`.

`index.html` was developed from 10:11 AM to 10:20 AM.  The file was initially empty, then progressively built into a basic HTML structure including `<head>` and `<body>` elements. The `<head>` section received meta tags for character set and viewport, and the title was changed multiple times, settling on "BCA"  Finally, a simple structure was created in the body consisting of an `<h1>` element, a `<p>` element, and a `<button>` element.  There was a brief reversion back to an empty `<body>` at 10:19, then back to the "BCA" title, and a final incomplete `<h1>` tag at the end.
