# Activity Summary for 8/17/2025

## 10:59:22 AM
The log shows modifications to two files: `script.js` and `index.html`.

`script.js` underwent extensive experimentation with variable declarations and assignments between 10:02 AM and 10:10 AM.  Initially, the code experimented with `var` declarations, then moved to using `const` and `let`, demonstrating learning about different variable scope and hoisting behaviors in JavaScript.  There were multiple attempts to declare and re-declare variables with the same name, and comments were added and removed to test code snippets. The variable names used were primarily `a` and then `b`.

`index.html` was developed from 10:11 AM to 10:20 AM.  The file was initially empty, then progressively built into a basic HTML structure including `<head>` and `<body>` elements. The `<head>` section received meta tags for character set and viewport, and the title was changed multiple times, settling on "BCA"  Finally, a simple structure was created in the body consisting of an `<h1>` element, a `<p>` element, and a `<button>` element.  There was a brief reversion back to an empty `<body>` at 10:19, then back to the "BCA" title, and a final incomplete `<h1>` tag at the end.


## 11:59:24 AM
The log shows development of a simple webpage.  Initially, an `index.html` file was created with basic HTML structure including a heading, paragraph, and button.  A `style.css` file was added and linked to the HTML around 11:08 AM.  The `script.js` file remained empty.

Significant changes to `style.css` involved styling the elements defined in `index.html`.  Between 11:14 AM and 11:15 AM, there was a period of correcting a typo in the `text-align` property for `.main-style`. Then,  the height and width of `.main-style` were adjusted several times between 11:15 AM and 11:22 AM, eventually settling on `height: 135px; width: 100%;`.  The button's border-radius was also added around 11:18 AM.  Subsequently, significant time was spent experimenting with font families for the `.button-style` class from around 11:19 AM to 11:26 AM, trying out "roboto", "monotono", "lobster" and finally settling on "Arial". A font size of 20px was also added.


Around 11:29 AM a new class `gajama-style` was added to the paragraph in `index.html`,  and its styling (background color and font size) was developed in `style.css` between 11:29 AM and 11:31 AM. Further styling adjustments to the heading (`heading-style`) and the paragraph (`gajama-style`) continued until 11:32 AM.

The final significant change started around 11:44 AM where the background color and text alignment were removed from `.main-style` in `style.css`, and a background image was added iteratively, with the size and URL adjusted and refined several times until settling on an image from `picfiles.alphacoders.com` around 11:51 AM. The background was further refined to use `background-size: cover; height: 100vh;` around 11:53 AM. The heading's background color was also removed around 11:52 AM.  The height and width of `.main-style` were commented out.


## 12:59:41 PM
The log shows development of a simple webpage ("index.html") and its associated stylesheet ("style.css").  The `index.html` file underwent significant changes between 12:14:09 PM and 12:29:16 PM, with multiple revisions focusing on refining the content of paragraphs within a main div.  Initially, placeholder content was used, subsequently replaced with more substantial text about the survival of the human race, which was iteratively edited.  The final version of the paragraph content seems complete.

The `style.css` file was also modified extensively, primarily focusing on the `.main-style` class.  The most substantial change in `style.css` involved adding and refining the background image within the `.main-style` class,  using a base64 encoded WebP image.  This modification occurred between 12:16:23 PM and 12:57:52 PM.  There were multiple intermediate commits adjusting the background size and other properties. Additional selectors (`.selector`, `.button-style`, `.gaj-style`, `.gaja-style`, `.karu-style`) were also added and modified, indicating progressive styling of the webpage's elements.  Finally, the `index.html` file's stylesheet link was corrected from "styles.css" to "style.css" at 12:42:18 PM.  The most significant styling updates occurred between 12:30:13 PM and 12:57:52 PM, with several commits refining the styling of the main-style class and various paragraph styles.  There is a noticeable pattern of incremental changes in both files throughout the entire logging period.


## 2:51:40 PM
The log shows a series of edits to two HTML files, `aniket.html` and `anku.html`, between 1:53 PM and 2:50 PM on August 17, 2025.  Both files utilize Bootstrap 4.5.3 for styling and jQuery 3.5.1 along with Popper.js for interactive elements.

**aniket.html:** This file's early changes focus on adding a button element and progressively refining its class attributes.  A significant change occurs at 1:55:04 PM with the inclusion of Bootstrap's JavaScript files and additional scripts.  Further edits between 1:55 PM and 2:05 PM involve adding multiple buttons with various Bootstrap classes (e.g., `btn btn-primary`, `btn btn-danger`, `btn btn-outline-primary`).  Finally, paragraphs with text content and class attributes for text color styling are added along with several h1 elements to add headings. The file is then edited again between 2:08 and 2:17 PM where the number of buttons are increased, some of the buttons have incorrect class names, some are removed and added again. The last edit at 2:17:47 PM seems to have stabilized the code, including a full set of colored buttons and paragraphs.  At 2:15:42 PM, there's a temporary removal of the bootstrap links and script tags, that are added back again in the next edit.

**anku.html:** This file's development starts at 2:22:20 PM. Initial changes involve creating a simple div, adding a heading, and then styling elements with Bootstrap classes, specifically focusing on background and text colors.  The content settles on "Tourism" as a heading and "Plan your trip" as a paragraph, both styled with the `bg-warning` class. A button element "Get started" is also added. The final version features a `div` container with a styled heading, a paragraph, and a button, all centered using Bootstrap classes (`text-center`).  The changes show a structured approach to creating a simple webpage using Bootstrap.  There are a few instances of incomplete or incorrect class names which are corrected in later edits.
