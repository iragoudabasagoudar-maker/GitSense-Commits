# Activity Summary for 8/21/2025

## 10:33:27 AM
The log shows development of a counter application and a webpage with a navigation bar and carousel.

**hey.js (Counter Application):**  This JavaScript file underwent multiple revisions between 9:39 AM and 9:54 AM.  The initial versions contained a critical error: `document.getElementById("")`, failing to specify an ID for the counter element.  Subsequent changes corrected this to `document.getElementById("counterValue")`.  There were also several iterations refining the increment and decrement functions, primarily correcting a variable name inconsistency (`updatedCounterValue` vs. `updatedValue`) and ensuring `updatedValue` was used consistently in updating the `textContent`.  The logic for color change based on counter value remained consistent throughout.

**count.html:** At 9:40:07 AM, a basic HTML file `count.html` was created. It includes a counter display (`id="counterValue"`), increment, decrement, and reset buttons, and links to external Bootstrap CSS and JS libraries, along with `hey.js` and `hey.css`. The button for increasing the counter was initially misspelled as "onIecrement".

**gok.html (Webpage):**  The `gok.html` file, created at 10:00:12 AM, started as an empty HTML document. It was then progressively enhanced by adding a Bootstrap-based navigation bar (10:00:19 AM), including Bootstrap CSS and JS links (10:00:43 AM), and styling changes to the navigation bar (moving the navigation items to the right using `ml-auto`, and changing the background color to dark).  Further edits added navigation links (10:16:46 AM - 10:17:24 AM), and finally a Bootstrap carousel (10:20:52 AM onwards).  Image sources were added and modified within the carousel (`src="..."` was replaced with actual image URLs).  The final version shows a complete webpage with a navbar and carousel.


**gok.css (Stylesheet):** This stylesheet, first created at 10:28:51 AM, underwent several modifications to style the carousel. Initial attempts had incorrect or missing height and width values, which were subsequently corrected and refined, culminating in setting the carousel slide width and height to 400px and adding a pink background color (10:32:57 AM).  The style specifically targets `.carousel slide .carousel-inner`  to adjust the height and width of the carousel images.


## 11:33:27 AM
The log shows edits to an HTML file and a CSS file, along with extensive modifications to a JavaScript file (`days-6.js`).

The `gok.html` file, updated at 10:34:47 AM, is a basic HTML page using Bootstrap for styling and layout. It includes a navigation bar and a carousel with images sourced from Bing image URLs.

The `gok.css` file underwent several changes between 10:34:55 AM and 10:43:47 AM.  These changes primarily focused on styling the carousel, adjusting its background color, width, height, and text alignment.  The `.carousel-inner` class's styling was commented out and uncommented multiple times, indicating experimentation with the carousel's inner dimensions.  The final state included a pink background, 400x400 dimensions, and center text alignment for the `.carousel-slide` class, and 200x200 dimensions for the `.carousel-inner` class.

The `days-6.js` file shows a development process over a significant time period.  Early edits between 10:47:54 AM and 10:49:59 AM focus on creating two functions, `demo1` and `demo2`. These functions initially contained incomplete code, gradually evolving to include `console.log` statements.  Between 10:55:50 AM and 11:01:32 AM, the code involved significant experimentation with `setInterval`, initially with syntax errors and ultimately settling on a corrected `setInterval` call within `demo1`, printing "first function" at an interval of 4 milliseconds.  Errors in the `interval` variable declaration and assignment were also corrected during this time. This was later changed to `setTimeout` at 11:06:17 AM and the time was increased gradually, finally settling at 1500 milliseconds.  From 11:09:26 AM onwards, the focus shifted to creating a commented-out function `bca` and experimenting with the setTimeout function. Finally, the code implements a `name` function using three `setTimeout` calls to simulate and log the completion of three tasks with increasing delays.  The final version of this function shows asynchronous operation, illustrating how to sequence tasks with delays.


## 12:33:25 PM
The log shows a single file, `days-6.js`, undergoing modifications between 11:35 AM and 11:41 AM on August 21, 2025.  Initially, the file contains commented-out code involving `setTimeout` functions for tasks and a `greet` function using a callback.

Between 11:35:04 AM and 11:36:23 AM, the commented-out code remains largely unchanged, with the addition and subsequent commenting-out of the `greet` function which takes a `displayName` callback and logs greetings.  There are also instances of the `greet` function appearing multiple times in some revisions within the same timestamp, suggesting some experimentation.

From 11:38:09 AM onwards, all the previously written code is commented out. A new function, `hi`, is defined and gradually developed. Initially empty, it then incorporates a `setTimeout` function that initially logs an empty string, then is modified to log "fetch" after a 2-second delay. Finally, a callback parameter is added to the `hi` function at 11:41:10 AM.  The primary focus of the changes shifts from the initial commented code to the development and refinement of the `hi` function and its use of `setTimeout` and callbacks.  The repeated commenting out of the previous code sections suggests the developer was iteratively experimenting with different approaches before settling on the `hi` function's structure. The frequent minor changes in the time period between 11:35 AM to 11:36 AM  and 11:38 AM to 11:41 AM suggests an iterative development process.
