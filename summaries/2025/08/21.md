# Activity Summary for 8/21/2025

## 10:33:27 AM
The log shows development of a counter application and a webpage with a navigation bar and carousel.

**hey.js (Counter Application):**  This JavaScript file underwent multiple revisions between 9:39 AM and 9:54 AM.  The initial versions contained a critical error: `document.getElementById("")`, failing to specify an ID for the counter element.  Subsequent changes corrected this to `document.getElementById("counterValue")`.  There were also several iterations refining the increment and decrement functions, primarily correcting a variable name inconsistency (`updatedCounterValue` vs. `updatedValue`) and ensuring `updatedValue` was used consistently in updating the `textContent`.  The logic for color change based on counter value remained consistent throughout.

**count.html:** At 9:40:07 AM, a basic HTML file `count.html` was created. It includes a counter display (`id="counterValue"`), increment, decrement, and reset buttons, and links to external Bootstrap CSS and JS libraries, along with `hey.js` and `hey.css`. The button for increasing the counter was initially misspelled as "onIecrement".

**gok.html (Webpage):**  The `gok.html` file, created at 10:00:12 AM, started as an empty HTML document. It was then progressively enhanced by adding a Bootstrap-based navigation bar (10:00:19 AM), including Bootstrap CSS and JS links (10:00:43 AM), and styling changes to the navigation bar (moving the navigation items to the right using `ml-auto`, and changing the background color to dark).  Further edits added navigation links (10:16:46 AM - 10:17:24 AM), and finally a Bootstrap carousel (10:20:52 AM onwards).  Image sources were added and modified within the carousel (`src="..."` was replaced with actual image URLs).  The final version shows a complete webpage with a navbar and carousel.


**gok.css (Stylesheet):** This stylesheet, first created at 10:28:51 AM, underwent several modifications to style the carousel. Initial attempts had incorrect or missing height and width values, which were subsequently corrected and refined, culminating in setting the carousel slide width and height to 400px and adding a pink background color (10:32:57 AM).  The style specifically targets `.carousel slide .carousel-inner`  to adjust the height and width of the carousel images.
