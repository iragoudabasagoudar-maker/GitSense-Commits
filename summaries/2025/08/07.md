# Activity Summary for 8/7/2025

## 1:28:22 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `index.html` on August 7th, 2025, between 12:32 PM and 1:27 PM.  Initially, the file contained an HTML table displaying student information, an unordered list of programming languages, and an ordered list of items.

Early changes (12:33 PM) involved seemingly accidental modifications to the closing `</table>` tag, replaced with `<audio>` or `<audi>` tags, subsequently corrected.  Around 12:36 PM, an audio element was added, its source initially blank, then pointing to an audio file (`mixkit-arcade-retro-game-over-213 (1).wav`) located in the user's Downloads folder.

Between 12:39 PM and 12:40 PM, a video element was introduced, with its source initially blank, then updated to point to a video file (`292827_large.mp4`) located in a `ruchita` subfolder on the Desktop.  Further edits refined the video and audio attributes. The dimensions of the video were also adjusted from an initial undefined size to 320x240.  Around 12:41 PM, unnecessary `width` attribute in the video tag was removed. Minor corrections were also made to the video and audio tags around 12:41 PM to 12:42 PM.

Later edits (12:47 PM onwards) added a heading "audio image" and then  a login form, which was gradually improved through multiple commits. The form starts simple, adding a username input field, then a submit button, a reset button, and finally a password field. The `lable` tag was corrected to `label`.  The `form` action is consistently set to `/submit-form`.  The final version includes a fully functional-looking login form with username/email and password fields, submit and reset buttons, and `required` attribute added for the username input. The closing tags of various elements are consistently corrected throughout the log.  The final edits (around 1:27 PM) correct the spelling of 'label'.
