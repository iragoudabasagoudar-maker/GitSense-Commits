# Activity Summary for 8/7/2025

## 1:28:22 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `index.html` on August 7th, 2025, between 12:32 PM and 1:27 PM.  Initially, the file contained an HTML table displaying student information, an unordered list of programming languages, and an ordered list of items.

Early changes (12:33 PM) involved seemingly accidental modifications to the closing `</table>` tag, replaced with `<audio>` or `<audi>` tags, subsequently corrected.  Around 12:36 PM, an audio element was added, its source initially blank, then pointing to an audio file (`mixkit-arcade-retro-game-over-213 (1).wav`) located in the user's Downloads folder.

Between 12:39 PM and 12:40 PM, a video element was introduced, with its source initially blank, then updated to point to a video file (`292827_large.mp4`) located in a `ruchita` subfolder on the Desktop.  Further edits refined the video and audio attributes. The dimensions of the video were also adjusted from an initial undefined size to 320x240.  Around 12:41 PM, unnecessary `width` attribute in the video tag was removed. Minor corrections were also made to the video and audio tags around 12:41 PM to 12:42 PM.

Later edits (12:47 PM onwards) added a heading "audio image" and then  a login form, which was gradually improved through multiple commits. The form starts simple, adding a username input field, then a submit button, a reset button, and finally a password field. The `lable` tag was corrected to `label`.  The `form` action is consistently set to `/submit-form`.  The final version includes a fully functional-looking login form with username/email and password fields, submit and reset buttons, and `required` attribute added for the username input. The closing tags of various elements are consistently corrected throughout the log.  The final edits (around 1:27 PM) correct the spelling of 'label'.


## 3:28:51 PM
The log shows development of two HTML files (`index.html`, `simple.html`) and a JavaScript file (`practise.js`).

`practise.js` initially contained a simple "hello world" log statement.  Between 2:59 PM and 3:00 PM, a button with an onclick event triggering an alert was added.  The button text was refined from an empty string to "click here". Finally, at 3:04 PM, the code reverted to just the "hello world" log.


`index.html` was created around 2:48 PM. It included a table of student data, an unordered and ordered list, embedded audio and video elements, and a simple login form.  The most significant change was the addition of a `<script src="practise.js"></script>` tag  around 2:48 PM which was initially malformed but corrected shortly after.


`simple.html` underwent multiple changes between 2:52 PM and 3:14 PM.  Initially, it was a very basic HTML file. A script tag including `practise.js` was added and then removed several times.  A `console.log` statement ("hiiii") appeared and disappeared. Finally, around 3:03 PM, a button identical to the one in `practise.js` was added; subsequently the button was moved outside the script tag at 3:14 PM. The script tag's location within the html file changed, showing experimentation with the script tag placement.  An empty `s.html` file was also created at 3:12 PM, suggesting the possibility of a new file being started.


## 4:28:50 PM
The log shows a single file, `practise.js`, being modified repeatedly on August 7th, 2025, between 3:38 PM and 3:45 PM.  The file contains JavaScript code that initially prints "hello world", declares and prints the value of variable `n` (initially 7), and then adds declarations and printing of other variables.

The key changes are additions and modifications to variable declarations and print statements.  Specifically:

* **3:38 PM:**  Initial commit with `n` declared as 7.
* **3:39 PM:** Variable `s` (value 18) is added.
* **3:43 PM - 3:44 PM:** Variable `n` is redeclared using `let`, assigned a value of 10, then 20, demonstrating variable reassignment and the use of `let`. This version is then simplified by removing the reassignment to 20.
* **3:44 PM - 3:45 PM:**  Further edits involve correcting syntax errors and ultimately replacing the redeclared `n` with a new variable `m` (also with value 10).  Several syntax errors are introduced and fixed during these modifications.


The overall pattern shows an iterative development process, with additions, corrections, and refinements to variable declarations and output statements.  There is a clear focus on experimenting with variable declaration (`var` vs. `let`) and reassignment within the Javascript code.
