# Activity Summary for 8/23/2025

## 10:32:28 AM
The log shows iterative development of a webpage (`d1.html`) and its associated stylesheet (`workshop-d1.css`).  The HTML file remains largely unchanged throughout the log, primarily focusing on adding a "Delivary and payment" section and refining the "Sustainable fashion" section with additional text and improved formatting at around 10:10 AM and 10:13 AM.  The changes consistently involve adding a paragraph describing sustainable fashion practices and improving the layout of this section.

The CSS file (`workshop-d1.css`) undergoes numerous minor updates between 9:46 AM and 10:02 AM,  primarily focused on adjusting the height of the `.nxt-card-image` class.  The initial height was undefined, followed by attempts to set it to `200px`, `50v` (likely intended as `50vh`, a viewport unit), and finally settling on `200px`.  The final modification at 10:02 AM included minor styling adjustments to the `.title` class, removing font-size and adding padding of 20px.  The content of `.nav-style` (background image) remains consistent throughout.  The overall pattern in the CSS changes suggests experimentation with the layout and dimensions of a new card element within the webpage.


## 11:32:32 AM
The log shows multiple updates to the `d1.html` file and the `workshop-d1.css` file between 10:32 AM and 11:25 AM on August 23, 2025.  The `d1.html` file, which appears to be an HTML page for an online clothing store, underwent numerous revisions.  These changes primarily focused on refining the layout and presentation of the website,  including minor textual corrections and additions.  For instance, there were several edits to the "Delivary and payment" section, improving the text's grammar and clarity, and adding a paragraph about a surprise gift.  The final changes focused on adding an image (`./redeem.jpg`) and styling the "Thank you" section, and applying a class "gift" to the image.

The `workshop-d1.css` file, which contains the styles for `d1.html`, also received multiple updates. The most significant changes involved styling the `.redeem` class, initially applying a background color and later changing to a radial gradient background.  The `.gift` class was also added and styled, and minor adjustments  to the banner height were made. The consistent use of base64 encoded WebP images in both HTML and CSS is a notable pattern, suggesting a focus on optimized image delivery.  The overall modifications to both files seem to be part of an iterative design and refinement process, focused on improving the user experience and visual appeal of the online store.


## 12:32:23 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `d1.html` and `workshop-d1.css` files between 11:44 AM and 12:03 PM on August 23, 2025.  The `d1.html` file, representing the main webpage, remains largely unchanged in its structure throughout the edits. The changes primarily involve minor text corrections and refinements to the contact information within the `<p>` and `<h3>` tags in the "shopify" section of the HTML. Specifically, the address is updated, and some minor typos are corrected.

The `workshop-d1.css` file, containing the stylesheet, undergoes several revisions. The most notable changes are in the `.shopify` class, where the background color is repeatedly adjusted. The initial dark color is tweaked multiple times, from a slightly lighter to a slightly darker shade of dark blue. There is also a modification to the `.png` class, specifically its height, increasing the height of the images in the shopify section from 100px to 150px.  The `redeem` class's height and padding are also altered. The consistent nature of these changes suggests fine-tuning of the visual aspects of the website, particularly its footer.  The base64 encoded image within the `nav-style` class and other image sources in the HTML remain unchanged, indicating that image assets themselves were not directly modified within this log.
