# Activity Summary for 8/23/2025

## 10:32:28 AM
The log shows iterative development of a webpage (`d1.html`) and its associated stylesheet (`workshop-d1.css`).  The HTML file remains largely unchanged throughout the log, primarily focusing on adding a "Delivary and payment" section and refining the "Sustainable fashion" section with additional text and improved formatting at around 10:10 AM and 10:13 AM.  The changes consistently involve adding a paragraph describing sustainable fashion practices and improving the layout of this section.

The CSS file (`workshop-d1.css`) undergoes numerous minor updates between 9:46 AM and 10:02 AM,  primarily focused on adjusting the height of the `.nxt-card-image` class.  The initial height was undefined, followed by attempts to set it to `200px`, `50v` (likely intended as `50vh`, a viewport unit), and finally settling on `200px`.  The final modification at 10:02 AM included minor styling adjustments to the `.title` class, removing font-size and adding padding of 20px.  The content of `.nav-style` (background image) remains consistent throughout.  The overall pattern in the CSS changes suggests experimentation with the layout and dimensions of a new card element within the webpage.
