# Activity Summary for 8/8/2025

## 10:21:15 AM
The log shows numerous edits to `index.html` between 9:27 AM and 9:47 AM on August 8th, 2025.  The file initially contained a basic HTML structure with a table of student data, an unordered list, an ordered list, an audio element, a video element, and a login form.

Early changes focused on correcting typos and adding a `<title>` tag within the `<head>` section, with the title evolving from "profile" to "profile page".  Around 9:29 AM, a `linkrel` tag (likely intending `<link rel>`) was added to include a stylesheet (`style.css`), but this had typographical errors initially which were subsequently fixed.

Subsequent modifications, starting around 9:32 AM, involved adding a `div` with the class "profile-card" to the `<body>`. This `div` was progressively enhanced to include an image using a placeholder URL (`https://via.placeholder.com/150`), an `alt` attribute for the image,  and a class for the image ("profile_image"). Finally, an `h1` with the id "name" was added and populated with "aishwarya", and a paragraph with the id "bio" was added and set to "web developer".  The structure of the profile card was finalized by 9:47 AM.  The content before the profile card addition remained largely unchanged throughout the entire process.


## 1:09:23 PM
The log shows extensive modification of the `App.js` and `login.js` files within `myreactapp` React application between 12:20 PM and 1:09 PM on August 8th, 2025.

Initially, `App.js` contained basic structure.  The developer then experimented with displaying different text ("apoorva dalawai", "login page", "profile photo", "pr", "profile"), and added an image component (though the `src` attribute remained mostly empty).

Around 12:30 PM, a login form was implemented in `App.js`, starting with a single username input field and gradually adding a password field and a submit button. The styling of these elements was refined with `<br>` tags and closing tags for input elements. This process involved several edits, correcting input types and placeholders.  Later,  the login form elements were removed from `App.js`.

At 12:42 PM, the developer started importing a `login` component, initially with incomplete import paths, before settling on `import login from "./components/login";`. This suggests a shift towards component-based development.

The `login.js` file was created subsequently and underwent iterative changes to build the login form component itself. This started with the creation of input fields for username and password, followed by addition of a submit button and removal of redundant code.

The final `App.js` file imports and renders the `login` component, simplifying the overall structure and showcasing the separation of concerns between the main app and the login form component.  There are a large number of near-identical entries which show the programmer changing and testing the code in various steps.
