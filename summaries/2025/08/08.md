# Activity Summary for 8/8/2025

## 10:21:15 AM
The log shows numerous edits to `index.html` between 9:27 AM and 9:47 AM on August 8th, 2025.  The file initially contained a basic HTML structure with a table of student data, an unordered list, an ordered list, an audio element, a video element, and a login form.

Early changes focused on correcting typos and adding a `<title>` tag within the `<head>` section, with the title evolving from "profile" to "profile page".  Around 9:29 AM, a `linkrel` tag (likely intending `<link rel>`) was added to include a stylesheet (`style.css`), but this had typographical errors initially which were subsequently fixed.

Subsequent modifications, starting around 9:32 AM, involved adding a `div` with the class "profile-card" to the `<body>`. This `div` was progressively enhanced to include an image using a placeholder URL (`https://via.placeholder.com/150`), an `alt` attribute for the image,  and a class for the image ("profile_image"). Finally, an `h1` with the id "name" was added and populated with "aishwarya", and a paragraph with the id "bio" was added and set to "web developer".  The structure of the profile card was finalized by 9:47 AM.  The content before the profile card addition remained largely unchanged throughout the entire process.
