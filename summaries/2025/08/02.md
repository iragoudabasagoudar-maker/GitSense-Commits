# Activity Summary for 8/2/2025

## 12:41:13 PM
The log shows multiple updates to the backend of a job portal application.  The `jobsmodel.js` file underwent several revisions between 12:19 PM and 12:20 PM on August 2nd, 2025, primarily involving minor formatting changes around the `applyLink` and `userid` fields within the job schema.  No significant functional changes occurred during these edits.

At 12:23 PM, the `jobsroutes.js` file was updated to define API routes for retrieving all jobs, getting a job by ID, posting a new job, deleting a job, and importing jobs.  These routes utilize functions from the `jobscontroller.js` file.

The `jobscontroller.js` file (updated at 12:26 PM) contains the implementation of the API routes defined in `jobsroutes.js`. It includes functions for posting, getting, updating, and deleting jobs, all with robust error handling and authorization checks to ensure only admins can perform certain actions.  The `importJobs` function uses services defined in `services.js` to fetch, process, and store jobs.

The `services.js` file (updated at 12:30 PM) contains the core logic for fetching job data from a LinkedIn API using RapidAPI, processing it using a Gemini AI model for standardization (with a fallback to manual mapping), and saving it to the database.  Helper functions for mapping employment types, seniority levels, and extracting skills are included. This file also uses a Gemini client (`geminiClient.js`) for AI-based processing. The `geminiClient.js` file uses the `GEMINI_API_KEY` from the environment variables to interact with the Gemini API.  Error handling is implemented throughout this file to manage failures at various stages of the process.
