# Activity Summary for 8/22/2025

## 10:35:18 AM
The log shows development of an HTML file (`workshop-d1.html`) and a CSS file (`workshop-d1.css`) for what appears to be a shopping website.

`workshop-d1.html` underwent several revisions between 9:47 AM and 10:34 AM on August 22, 2025.  Initially, it was an empty HTML file.  Significant changes include:

* **9:49 AM:** Bootstrap 5 CSS and Javascript files were added.
* **9:50 AM:** The title was changed to "Shopping website," and a `<div>` was added to the body.
* **9:50-9:52 AM:** Bootstrap's container and row classes were implemented for layout.
* **9:57 AM:**  A main heading ("Responsive website") was added.
* **9:58-10:01 AM:** Column classes (`col-xl-3`, `col-12`, etc) were used to create a grid layout.  Colored divs with "primary" text were added.
* **10:01-10:04 AM:** More colored divs were added, extending the grid layout.
* **10:04-10:08 AM:** The code was refined, improving the column classes and adding "secondary" colored divs.  The text inside some divs was changed to "secondary."
* **10:09 AM:** A major refactoring occurred, switching to Bootstrap 4.  More color palettes (success, info, warning, danger) were introduced.
* **10:14 AM:**  The stylesheet (`workshop-d1.css`) was linked correctly.


`workshop-d1.css` was created and modified between 10:12 AM and 10:32 AM on August 22, 2025.  The file was initially empty, then various attempts were made to set the background color of the container, culminating in a linear gradient from red to black.  Later, it was styled to include  `background-size: cover;` for the navigation bar. At the very end,  a background-color:red was added to the container class.

A second HTML file, `d1.html`, was created around 10:16 AM.  This file incorporated Bootstrap 4 and linked to `workshop-d1.css`.  It was then progressively developed to include a navigation bar similar to that in the final version of `workshop-d1.html`.  An image was added to the navbar's brand section (around 10:29-10:34 AM).

In summary, the log documents the iterative development of a responsive webpage using Bootstrap. The developer started with Bootstrap 5, switched to Bootstrap 4, and added styling and content incrementally.  The final `d1.html` is almost a copy of the final version of `workshop-d1.html`, suggesting `workshop-d1.html` might have been abandoned in favor of a cleaner `d1.html`.  There are also a few typos present in the code throughout the process, particularly in spelling "secondary".


## 11:35:12 AM
The log shows modifications to a CSS file (`workshop-d1.css`) and an HTML file (`d1.html`) between 10:35 AM and 11:24 AM on August 22, 2025.  The majority of changes are focused on `workshop-d1.css`.

**`workshop-d1.css` updates:**

* **Initial commit (10:35 AM):** Defines `.nav-style` and `.container` classes, setting background color, height, and background image for the navigation bar and container respectively.  The background image in the container is initially specified using a URL.

* **Subsequent commits (10:37 AM - 10:40 AM):**  Multiple revisions adjust the height and width properties of the `.container` class, aiming to make it full-screen.  `height: 100%`, `height: 100vh`, `width: 100%`, and `width: 100vh` were experimented with before settling on `height: 100vh` and using `background-size: cover`.  Minor whitespace changes are also observed.

* **Base64 Image Encoding (10:47 AM):** The background image URL for `.container` is replaced with a Base64 encoded WebP image.  This significantly reduces file size for the image.

* **`.logo` class addition (10:49 AM - 11:05 AM):**  A new class, `.logo`, is added to style the logo image, initially with height and width specified as 100px and later adding a border radius to create a circular effect.  The border radius value is adjusted from 50px to 80px in subsequent commits.

* **`.nav-style` commenting out (11:05 AM - 11:24 AM):** The `.nav-style` CSS is commented out, suggesting a possible change of approach or temporary removal.

* **Banner styling (11:24 AM):**  Styles are added for the `.banner-heading` and `.banner-caption` classes.  This suggests the addition of a banner section to the HTML.


**`d1.html` updates:**

* **Initial commit (10:44 AM):**  A basic HTML structure is created using Bootstrap 4.5.3, including a navigation bar, and a home screen section with buttons.  The `workshop-d1.css` stylesheet is linked.

* **Minor change (10:48 AM):** An extra space is added to the image element in the navigation bar.

* **Adding a class to the logo (10:48 AM):** A 'logo' class is added to the image tag in the navbar.

* **Typographical correction (11:04 AM):** A typo in the class name `.banner-section-bg-container` is corrected.


**Overall Pattern:**

The CSS file underwent iterative changes, primarily focusing on the layout and styling of the container and logo.  The use of Base64 encoding for the background image indicates an optimization effort.  The HTML file shows minor structural improvements. The later changes show a focus on refining styling and potentially switching to a different approach to styling the navigation bar.
