# Activity Summary for 8/22/2025

## 10:35:18 AM
The log shows development of an HTML file (`workshop-d1.html`) and a CSS file (`workshop-d1.css`) for what appears to be a shopping website.

`workshop-d1.html` underwent several revisions between 9:47 AM and 10:34 AM on August 22, 2025.  Initially, it was an empty HTML file.  Significant changes include:

* **9:49 AM:** Bootstrap 5 CSS and Javascript files were added.
* **9:50 AM:** The title was changed to "Shopping website," and a `<div>` was added to the body.
* **9:50-9:52 AM:** Bootstrap's container and row classes were implemented for layout.
* **9:57 AM:**  A main heading ("Responsive website") was added.
* **9:58-10:01 AM:** Column classes (`col-xl-3`, `col-12`, etc) were used to create a grid layout.  Colored divs with "primary" text were added.
* **10:01-10:04 AM:** More colored divs were added, extending the grid layout.
* **10:04-10:08 AM:** The code was refined, improving the column classes and adding "secondary" colored divs.  The text inside some divs was changed to "secondary."
* **10:09 AM:** A major refactoring occurred, switching to Bootstrap 4.  More color palettes (success, info, warning, danger) were introduced.
* **10:14 AM:**  The stylesheet (`workshop-d1.css`) was linked correctly.


`workshop-d1.css` was created and modified between 10:12 AM and 10:32 AM on August 22, 2025.  The file was initially empty, then various attempts were made to set the background color of the container, culminating in a linear gradient from red to black.  Later, it was styled to include  `background-size: cover;` for the navigation bar. At the very end,  a background-color:red was added to the container class.

A second HTML file, `d1.html`, was created around 10:16 AM.  This file incorporated Bootstrap 4 and linked to `workshop-d1.css`.  It was then progressively developed to include a navigation bar similar to that in the final version of `workshop-d1.html`.  An image was added to the navbar's brand section (around 10:29-10:34 AM).

In summary, the log documents the iterative development of a responsive webpage using Bootstrap. The developer started with Bootstrap 5, switched to Bootstrap 4, and added styling and content incrementally.  The final `d1.html` is almost a copy of the final version of `workshop-d1.html`, suggesting `workshop-d1.html` might have been abandoned in favor of a cleaner `d1.html`.  There are also a few typos present in the code throughout the process, particularly in spelling "secondary".
